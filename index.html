                    <h2>Where to Start with K-Dramas: My Top 5 Recommendations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Next to BTS (--only 3 more months until they're all home!), one of the Korean cultural exports everyone's talking
                        about these days is korean dramas, also known as k-dramas. For those of us who don't have the money to drop on roundtrip
                        airfare to Korea, k-dramas are a great way to hear and study the language, learn a little bit about the culture (I say a tiny bit because
                        k-dramas are about as real as the tv shows you watch in your own country), and see a <strong>lot</strong> of delicious-looking food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        K-dramas have a lot of genres and something for everybody, but that's exactly why it can be tricky to know what to start watching.
                        Below, I've ranked some of the k-dramas that I've enjoyed and think would be a great introduction to the experience.
                        I tend to like more fantasy, slice-of-life, and historical dramas, so that's what you'll mostly see here. If you like them, then 
                        you'll have a good idea of what to start looking for next.
                    <h3>Modern K-Dramas</h3>
                    <p>
                        These k-dramas happen in modern times, or at least times that don't feel <em>too</em> far past

                    <p>
                        These k-dramas tend to happen during the time of the Goreyo and Joseon Dynasties...with one
                        from the late 1990s.
