Project 3
Due: 3/6/25

I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.

--SELF GRADE--
I think I did well on all requirements

--REFLECTION--
This would've been a lot more fun if the assignments were inline with what the actual reading is supposed to be for class. It took me
so long to get the tabs working properly that I don't feel like my website is as good as I wanted it to be (for example, sadly, no image
gallery). I also kept having problems with Netlify and my computer freezing. All-in-all, I think I did pretty well under the circumstances. Since it's spring I themed my page with cherry blossom colors.

                    <h2>Where to Start with K-Dramas: My Top 5 Recommendations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Next to BTS (--only 3 more months until they're all home!), one of the Korean cultural exports everyone's talking
                        about these days is korean dramas, also known as k-dramas. For those of us who don't have the money to drop on roundtrip
                        airfare to Korea, k-dramas are a great way to hear and study the language, learn a little bit about the culture (I say a tiny bit because
                        k-dramas are about as real as the tv shows you watch in your own country), and see a <strong>lot</strong> of delicious-looking food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        K-dramas have a lot of genres and something for everybody, but that's exactly why it can be tricky to know what to start watching.
                        Below, I've ranked some of the k-dramas that I've enjoyed and think would be a great introduction to the experience.
                        I tend to like more fantasy, slice-of-life, and historical dramas, so that's what you'll mostly see here. If you like them, then 
                        you'll have a good idea of what to start looking for next.
                    <h3>Modern K-Dramas</h3>
                    <p>
                        These k-dramas happen in modern times, or at least times that don't feel <em>too</em> far past

                            she can resolve her grudge--by possessing someone's body and doing "the deed". Na Bong-sun is a shy young woman
                            working in the restaurant of a famous chef, who she has a crush on, when she unknowingly crosses paths with Shin Soon-ae. 
                            Shin Soon-ae decides to help both of them out by "borrowing" Na Bong-sun's body for a bit to try and hook up with the chef.
                            It's hilarious and not as dirty as it sounds.
